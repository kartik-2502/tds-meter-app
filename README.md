## Water Quality Standards

The application automatically classifies water quality based on TDS levels:

| TDS Level (ppm) | Quality | Color Code |
|-----------------|---------|------------|
| 0-50 | Excellent | Green |
| 51-150 | Good | Yellow |
| 151-300 | Fair | Orange |
| 300+ | Poor | Red |
